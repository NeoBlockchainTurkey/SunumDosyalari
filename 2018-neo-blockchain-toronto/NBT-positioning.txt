NEO Blockchain Toronto - Positioning

What we're about

NEO Blockchain Toronto (https://www.meetup.com/NEO-Blockchain-Toronto/) is a non-profit, community-based Meetup group for blockchain developers and architects interested in designing and creating Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) (aka blockchain) solutions using the NEO Blockchain platform.

NEO (https://neo.org/) is a non-profit, community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, to automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and to realize a "smart economy" with a distributed network.

This meetup is a group that it is currently independent of the official NEO Project (https://github.com/neo-project) and City of Zion (https://github.com/CityOfZion/) projects. I'm looking forward to this changing in the future.

Best regards,
Michael Herman (Toronto)
